# Nx and Angular Playground

## What

A test/playground based on the amazing [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to play with the newest [Nx](https://nx.dev) and [Angular](https://angular.io) _'best practices'_ like [Standalone Components](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components), `Inject()` and plenty more. While following Semantic HTML and newest CSS solutions.

Using tools like: [Cypress](https://cypress.io), [MSWjs](https://mswjs.io), [Zod](https://zod.dev/?id=introduction) and others.

Trying to provide a good base for both a learning and as a starter repository.
