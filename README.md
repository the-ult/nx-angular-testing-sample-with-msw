# Nx and Angular Playground

## What

A Movies DB demo app based on the amazing [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to play with the newest [Nx](https://nx.dev) and [Angular](https://angular.io) _'best practices'_ like [Standalone Components](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components), `Inject()` and plenty more. While following Semantic HTML and newest CSS solutions.

Providing the best [VSCode settings](.vscode/settings.json), [VSCode extensions](.vscode/extensions.json) and [ESLint](.eslintrc.json) settings.

Using tools like: [Cypress](https://cypress.io), [MSWjs](https://mswjs.io), [Zod](https://zod.dev/?id=introduction), [Testing Library Angular](https://testing-library.com/docs/angular-testing-library/intro/) and others.

Trying to provide a good base for both a learning and as a starter repository.

## Screenshots

[TODO]

## Why

I wanted to write a blogpost about using [MSWjs](https://mswjs.io) in a Nx repo with both Cypress, Cypress Component Tests and Jest/Testing-library.
To be able to write a proper blogpost, I needed to setup a proper example repo.
While creating this example repo, I figured, let's use and try the newest Angular best practices.
And create an example app, which can be used as a starter/example for future projects as well.

(The blogpost is still WIP üòá)

## Tech / Tools used

- [Nx](https://nx.dev)
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
- [Cypress](https://cypress.io)
  - [Cypress Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library) - for end to end test assertions
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) - for running unit tests
  - [Testing Library Angular](https://testing-library.com/docs/angular-testing-library/intro/) - for unit test assertions
- [MSWjs](https://mswjs.io)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/?id=introduction)

## Setup

#### Enable pnpm

```
‚ùØ corepack enable
```

### Install dependencies

```
‚ùØ pnpm install

```

## Run

#### Start dev server with MSW mocking at localhost:4200

```
‚ùØ pnpm start:msw movie-db
```

OR

```
‚ùØ nx mock movie-db
```

Or run with live data.

> In this case you first have to add your TMDB BEARER token
> to [apps/movie-db/.env.serve](./apps/movie-db/.env.serve)
>
> _See: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/authentication#bearer-token_

```
‚ùØ nx serve movie-db
```

### E2E

```
‚ùØ pnpm e2e:msw
```

OR

```
‚ùØ nx e2e movie-db-e2e [--watch --browser=chrome]
```

## Best practices followed

- Using [Standalone components](https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components)
- Use `inject()` instead of `constructor()` to initialize services
  - **N.B**
    We Set the `"target": "ES2022"`, which means the `"useDefineForClassFields"` is automatically set to `true`. And Angular will not set it to `false`.
    We do this to force the use of `inject()` instead of using Dependency Injection via the `constructor()`, which is not EcmaScript-compliant and be [future proof](https://angular.schule/blog/2022-11-use-define-for-class-fields) and avoid future breaking changes.
- Strict settings in `tsconfig` and with `ESLint` to help/force best practices
- Use [Nx - Grouping libraries](https://nx.dev/more-concepts/grouping-libraries#example-workspace) with a little DDD sauce, to force a cohesive structure
- functional Interceptors and functional Guards

## Things I would like to add / improve

- [ ] Working Cypress Component Tests with MSWjs 
    - They now result in a race condition. See: [MSW leaves cypress component test runner in a loop](https://github.com/mswjs/msw/issues/744)
- [ ] Proper Error handling
- [ ] Add proper Logging `provideLogger()`
- [ ] Setup Github actions and github page
- [ ] Do not use image url's while testing (add images to mock assets)
- [ ] [@ngrx/component-store](https://ngrx.io/guide/component-store) or [@ngneat/elf](https://ngneat.github.io/elf/)
- [ ] [Playwright tests](https://playwright.dev/)
- [ ] Create an app with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [ ] New App with [GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server) and TypedDocumentNode
- [ ] Separate branches / forks (Or.. since it is a mono-repo in the same repo) for:
  - [ ] Build with ESBuild
  - [ ] Vite
  - [ ] [Rome](https://rome.tools/)
